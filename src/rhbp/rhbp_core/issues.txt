action should be able to have a duration and not block the behaviour network
    if so: how to communicate with them / control them
        start
        interrupt
        preempt
        how to detect when finished?
    *************
    actionlib
    rosservice
    
execute only behaviours in parallel that don't interfere with each other
    or only those that are aggreagatable
    *************
    look for common actuators to decide

activation must spread in a well-defined manner
    aggregation introduces integral growth of waiting behaviours at the moment
    *************
    look at Maes again!

PDDL generation
    preconditions and effects must be known

FD interface

timing check interface
